Portfolio app
I took a partial design and designed an additional page, the Reservation page in figma. 
After building most of the app, I implemented a function that allows the user to reserve only times that are still available at a restaurant. 
I built it by creating reusable components (cards, etc.) so that if the restaurant wanted to change any pictures or text in their menu or about section that it could be changed easily and then those changes would be available
everywhere that they're used in the web app (web site).
I built this page with React, javascript, HTML, and CSS.
I chose to use no bootstrap to build upon my foundation of knowledge and skills using CSS to make the page responsive from 320px width and up to regular or moderately wide screens.
The color scheme added an additional challenge as I didn't find it appealing and had to use creativity to design the header and footers within the available colors on the design template.
I built a hamburger menu for smaller screen sizes to replace the links at the top.
